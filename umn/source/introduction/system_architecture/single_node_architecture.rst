Single Node Architecture
========================

A single node instance, as its name suggests, contains only one node which can be accessed directly.

As a supplement to the cluster and replica set architectures, the single-node architecture applies to R&D, testing, and non-core data storage of enterprises. While not as robust as replica sets, the single node architecture can be a less expensive way to visualize O&M and provide elastic scaling.

.. note::

   A driver handles all interactions between your application and the database in a language appropriate to the application. For details, see `official documents <https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/>`__.
