Ease of Use
===========

Instant Availability
--------------------

You can create a DB instance on the management console and access DDS through an Elastic Cloud Server (ECS) to reduce the application response time. If you need to access a DB instance from your local devices, you can bind an elastic IP address (EIP) to the instance.

High Compatibility
------------------

DDS is a document-oriented NoSQL database. It is fully compatible with MongoDB.

Easy O&M
--------

You can easily perform restart, backup, and data recovery operations on instances using a graphical user interface (GUI)
