What Precautions Should Be Taken When Using DDS?
================================================

#. Precautions after applying for DDS:

   After purchasing DDS DB instances, you do not need to perform basic database O&M operations, such as HA and security patches. You need to pay attention to the following:

   a. Whether the vCPUs, IOPS, and storage space for DDS DB instances are sufficient. If any of them is insufficient, optimize or upgrade the related configuration.
   b. Whether the performance of DDS DB instances is satisfying, whether a large number of slow query statements exist, whether query statements need to be optimized, and whether any index is redundant or missing.
