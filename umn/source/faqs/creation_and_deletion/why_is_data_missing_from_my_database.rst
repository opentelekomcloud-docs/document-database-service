Why Is Data Missing from My Database?
=====================================

DDS does not delete or perform any operations on any user data. If this problem occurs, check whether a misoperation has been performed. Restore the data using backup files, if necessary.

Solution:

-  Use the DDS restoration function to restore data. For details, see chapter "Backup and Restore" in the *Document Database Service User Guide*.
-  Import backups to DDS. For details, see section :ref:`Migrating Data <dds_03_0052>`.
