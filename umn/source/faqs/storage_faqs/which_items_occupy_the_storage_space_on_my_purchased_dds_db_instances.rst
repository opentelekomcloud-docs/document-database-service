Which Items Occupy the Storage Space on My Purchased DDS DB Instances?
======================================================================

Both your common data (excluding backup data) and data required for ensuring DB instance proper running occupy the storage space on your purchased DDS DB instances. To ensure DB instance proper running, system database data, rollback logs, and indexes are required. Logs generated by DDS also occupy the DB instance storage space. These files ensure that DB instances run stably.
